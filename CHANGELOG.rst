* Allow Markdown fence options.

  Thanks to initial work from Matthew Anderson in `PR #246 <https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs/pull/246>`__.

* Expand Markdown detection to all Python language names from Pygments: ``py``, ``sage``, ``python3``, ``py3``, and ``numpy``.

* Preserve leading blank lines with whitespace in reStructuredText code blocks.

  Thanks to Julianus Pfeuffer for the report in `Issue #217 <https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs/issues/217>`__.

* Remove ``language_version`` from ``.pre-commit-hooks.yaml``.
  This change allows ``default_language_version`` in ``.pre-commit-config.yaml` to take precedence.
